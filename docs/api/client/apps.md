# apps

A list of spawnable widgets. while jabby exposes widgets for many applications, the
only one that should be needed for the user is the home app.

Widgets can be spawned through [`client.spawn_app`](./spawn_app.md).

## home

The home widget is the entry point for a developer into jabby. It provides basic
oversight about the available schedulers and worlds available and lets you filter
for servers or players. It takes no config.
